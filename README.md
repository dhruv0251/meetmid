# MeetMid

MeetMid is a smart location-based web app that helps two people find the best meetup spot halfway between them whether it’s a cozy café, a lively park, or a popular mall. Designed for friends, couples, or colleagues, the app ensures fairness by calculating a midpoint based on travel time or distance, not just geography.

Key Features:

📍 Input two locations manually or via map/geolocation

🧠 Intelligent midpoint detection using Google Maps APIs

☕ Suggests high-quality cafes, malls, and parks near the midpoint

🚗 Shows distance from both users to each place
